# Contributions to DynoLabs

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the DynoLabs project. We are
happy to have you on board! The following gives information on how to contribute
and some guiding principles.

## Governance
Currently the team of DevOps Lab Engineers (DLE) serve as the governance board
and approving members of the team for any merges into the main branch.  If you
wish to make changes that affect the core libraries, please discuss the
architecture and types of changes you wish to make with a member of this team
before submitting a pull
request. This ensures that your ideas and changes will have a smooth approval
process and not waste any of your time having to re-work your code.

## How to Contribute
Please create a development branch from the main branch and code your
contribution to the library in the new branch.
Submit a PR to merge your changes into the main
branch and the core team will review/merge your PR.

## Code Placement
Please note the following about where to contribute code.

- If your code will be used by all courses, contribute your code to the
_src/labs_ portion of the repository.
- If your code is an example of how to use core functionality, contribute your
code to the _packages-gl006_ portion of the repository.
- If your code is a common routine for a particular product, e.g. OpenShift,
please contribute that to the appropriate repository, e.g. _rht-labs-ocp_.
- If your code is relevant only to your course, please contribute your code to
the specific course repository.

## Coding Conventions

- Python style guide: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/.

- Linter: flake8 will be used to check coding standards. See https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/.

- Target Python version 3.6

 You may use higher versions for development but it must work with this version of Python

- Use data typing hints (is this the right terminology?)

## Version Bumping
Make sure to increase the version number appropriately
when submitting a PR.  Adjustments to the version may be made by Governance
if required due to conflicting PRs.
