# Releasing `rht-labs-core`
The lab framework is delivered as Python packages by using Python index severs (PyPI).
We use Nexus PyPI servers to publish and deliver grading packages.
The following servers are used.

```{include} ../_templates/pypi_servers.md
```

## Versioning

This package follows a **semantic versioning** approach.

The version is specified in the `src/labs/version.py` file.



:::{admonition} **Do not edit the `rht-labs-core` version file!**
:class: danger

Instead, [build the Jenkins pipeline](https://jenkins.prod.nextcle.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/rht-labs-core/branches)
to create and release new versions. Jenkins will modify the version file
and create new tags.
:::



## Releases to PyPI Stage

Jenkins pushes a development version for each new Pull Request to [PyPI
Stage](https://pypi.apps.tools.dev.nextcle.com/#browse/browse:labs).

The development version follows the `X.Y.Z.dev${PR-number}` format,
where `X.Y.Z` is the semantic version specified in the
`src/labs/version.py` file.

Example:

    YOU open the Pull Request #23 ----> Jenkins creates a "X.Y.Z.devPR-23" dev version ----> Jenkins pushes the version to PyPI Stage

Releases to PyPI Stage do not modify the version file.

Development versions can be installed as any other version, for example:

``` sh
pip install rht-labs-core==2.0.9.devPR-23 --extra-index-url https://pypi.apps.tools-na100.dev.ole.redhat.com/repository/labs/simple
```

## Releasing to PyPI Prod

To release to Prod:

1.  Go to: **[Release to
    PROD](https://jenkins.prod.nextcle.com/job/Dynolabs/job/rht-labs-core/job/master/build)**

2.  Select the `VersionBump` increment (major\|minor\|patch). Jenkins
    will modify the version file, create a Git tag with the version, and
    push the changes to the master branch.

3.  Select `Publish`. This will make Jenkins push the new version to
    PyPI Prod, and create a new GitHub release.

4.  Click `Build`.

5.  Watch the build on Blue Ocean and confirm the version bump.

    The prompt times out if you donâ€™t confirm quickly. If the prompt
    times out, then rerun the job without bump, checking the publish
    option.

6.  Go to [the releases page on
    GitHub](https://github.com/RedHatTraining/rht-labs-core/releases).
    Edit the last release. Use `Auto-generate release notes`. Click
    `Update release`.

:::{note}
You can only release to PROD from to the master branch
